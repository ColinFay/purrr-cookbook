# How to read this book {-}

This book is divided in `r length(list.files(pattern = "Rmd")) - 4` chapters. 

Each chapter contains a random number of receipes, more or less from the easiest to more complex examples.

- "Statistics" contains a list of useful common stat tricks with {purrr}
- "Webmining" gives you elements to mine info from the web (HTML / JSON)
- "Text Wrangling" covers some text mining methods
- "Code optimisation" is a chapter about using {purrr} to write better code
- "Data Wrangling" is a list of receipes I couldn't fit anywhere else ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Based on other programming cookbook template, each receipe is divided as such: 

- "I want to...": what you want to do 
- "Here's how to": how to do this 
- "Ok, but why?": more explanations about the solution
- "See also": further references if you want to go deeper

## Who is this cookbook for?  {-}

Anybody interested in learning more about {purrr}, either by reading this from cover to cover (well... figuratively speaking), of by picking what you find interesting. 

## Before reading  {-}

We expect the reader to be a little bit familiar with R, and with the core packages from the tidyverse. 

Copy and paste the below code to be sure you have all the packages you need.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("broom")
install.packages("rvest")
install.packages("attempt")
install.packages("tidystringdist")
install.packages("tidytext")
```

Let's launch the tidyverse to be sure we have everything we need: 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## You want another receipe {-}

## You want to share a receipe {-}

I'll be glad to add other {purrr} receipes, so if ever you want to share one (or more), feel free to make a PR on the GitHub repo.

## What to do if you find a typo  {-}

Nobody's perfect and this book might contains typos. So please, yes please, open a PR (or feel free to reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay))
